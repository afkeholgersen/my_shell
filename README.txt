TO Compile: 
make compiles into executable "my_shell" 
make clean to clear this 

Implemented Parts of Assignment: 
Pipes fully Implemented 
Jobs partially implemented: calling jobs prints out job ids for all possible jobs running 
Internal Commands cd and exit implemented
MAX input is declared at top of file and can be changed for large input lines 
Exit will exit current process if one is running or the entire shell program. 

Reference Files: 
- shell-pipe.c from class to help with implementing piping 
- Used "Hints for Assignment One" main loop and system calls 
- Looked at : brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/ to help with parsing the input line 
- Looked at all websites listed in FAQ (gnu.org) on sample shell creation 
- Also asked TA for help :)
